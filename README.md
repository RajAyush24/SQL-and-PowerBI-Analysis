**Project Overview**
- The goal of this project was to analyze the pizza sales data to extract key indicators and then visualize these indicators using Power BI. This helps in understanding the data better and ensuring that the visualizations match the results obtained from SQL queries.

**Data Source**
- The data used for this analysis is from the file pizza_sales.csv (https://github.com/RajAyush24/SQL-and-PowerBI-Analysis/blob/main/pizza_sales.csv), which contains sales records of pizzas.

**SQL Analysis**
- The initial analysis was conducted using SQL to derive key indicators from the pizza_sales.csv file. The following key metrics were analyzed:
  - KPI's
  - Daily Trend for Total Orders
  - Monthly Trend for Orders
  - % of Sales by Pizza Category
  - % of Sales by Pizza Size
  - Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
  - Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue
  - Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue

The SQL queries used for the analysis are available in the (https://github.com/RajAyush24/SQL-and-PowerBI-Analysis/blob/main/PIZZA%20SALES%20SQL%20QUERIES.docx) file in this repository.

**Power BI Analysis**
- After conducting the analysis using SQL, the pizza_sales.csv file was imported into Power BI. The same key indicators were analyzed and visualized using various charts and graphs. This process ensured that the visualized data matched the SQL analysis.

**Dashboard**
- A comprehensive dashboard was created in Power BI to showcase the analyzed parameters. The dashboard provides insights into the sales performance and trends.
